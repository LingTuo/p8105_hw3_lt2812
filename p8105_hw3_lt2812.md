This is my solution to HW3.

Problem 1
---------

    data("instacart")

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns.

Observations are the level of items in orders by users. There are user /
order variables – user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour. There
are also item variables – name, aisle, department, and some numeric
codes.

How many aisles, and which are most items from?

    instacart %>% 
      count(aisle) %>% 
      arrange(desc(n))

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

Let’s make a plot.

    plot_p1 = 
      instacart %>% 
      count(aisle) %>% 
      filter(n > 10000) %>% 
      mutate(
        aisle = factor(aisle),
        aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
      ) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
      geom_point() +
      theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))

    ggsave("plot_p1.png", plot_p1)

Let’s make a table.

    instacart %>% 
      filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
      group_by(aisle) %>% 
      count(product_name) %>% 
      mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
      filter(rank < 4) %>% 
      arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
      knitr::kable()

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|

Apples vs ice cream.

    instacart %>% 
      filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
      group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
      summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
      pivot_wider(
        names_from = order_dow,
        values_from = mean_hour
      )

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

Problem 2
---------

-   Firstly, load and tidy data.

<!-- -->

    accel_data = read_csv(file = "./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
      pivot_longer(
        activity.1:activity.1440,
        names_to = "min_of_day",
        names_prefix = "activity.",
        values_to = "activity_count"
        ) %>% 
      mutate(
        day = factor(day),
        min_of_day = as.numeric(min_of_day),
        day_of_week = case_when(
          day %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday") ~ "weekday",
          day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday") ~ "weekend"
          )
        ) 

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

This dataset has 50400 rows and 6 columns. Observations are activity
counts of a person with CHF in orders by minutes of a 24-hour day. There
are time variables – week, day ID, day， minute of the day, day of the
week(weekday or weekend) and activity counts variable.

-   Then, calculate the total activity over the day.

<!-- -->

    accel_data %>% 
      group_by(week, day) %>% 
      summarize(sum_activity_count = sum(activity_count)) %>% 
      pivot_wider(
        names_from = day,
        values_from = sum_activity_count
      ) %>% 
      select(week, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday) %>% 
      knitr::kable()

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'week' (override with `.groups` argument)

| week | Sunday |    Monday |  Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday |   Friday | Saturday |
|-----:|-------:|----------:|---------:|----------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|
|    1 | 631105 |  78828.07 | 307094.2 |    340115 | 355923.6 | 480542.6 |   376254 |
|    2 | 422018 | 295431.00 | 423245.0 |    440962 | 474048.0 | 568839.0 |   607175 |
|    3 | 467052 | 685910.00 | 381507.0 |    468869 | 371230.0 | 467420.0 |   382928 |
|    4 | 260617 | 409450.00 | 319568.0 |    434460 | 340291.0 | 154049.0 |     1440 |
|    5 | 138421 | 389080.00 | 367824.0 |    445366 | 549658.0 | 620860.0 |     1440 |

According to the table, the person tended to have more stable total
activity time on Tuesday and Wednesday. It shows that his activity time
are higher in the first three weeks on weekends.

-   Lastly, make the plot of the 24-hour activity time courses for each
    day.

<!-- -->

    plot_p2 = 
      accel_data %>% 
      group_by(week, day) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = min_of_day, y = activity_count, color = day, alpha = .3)) + 
      geom_point() +
      geom_line() +
      labs(
        title = "24-hour activity time courses for each day",
        x = "Minute of the day/hours(min/h)",
        y = "Activity counts") + 
      scale_x_continuous(
        breaks = c(0, 180, 360, 540, 720, 900, 1080, 1260, 1440),
        labels = c("0/0h", "180/3h", "360/6h", "540/9h", "720/12h", "900/15h", "1080/18h", "1260/21h", "1440/24h")
      )

    ggsave("plot_p2.png", plot_p2)

    ## Saving 6 x 3.6 in image

The plot indicates that there are low activity in the night, from 9 p.m
- 6 a.m. and there are a few peaks unevenly spread during daytime from
Monday to Sunday. Especially, the most frequently activity time is
around 9 p.m.
